This is the Scrabble asignment.
I was able to get scoring to work but not with valid words unfortunately.
It will score for any letters you enter.

The double letter tile will double that letter score! :)

There is a minor bug where if you hold a letter over a section that already
has a tile, that section will clear out its data (thinking the tile in its
spot was moved) meaning the score will be incorrect sometimes.

Refreshing the page will give a new set of letters.
The letters are pulled using the correct frequencies.
